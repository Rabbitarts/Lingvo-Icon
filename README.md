````
# Icon styles
  
Icons have 3 default styles: *li-solid*, *li-regular*, *li-brand*, each of which means the style of the icon: for example, li-solid means that the icon will be filled with color completely and li-regular means that the icon will look like a stroke

# Here's an example of how to use the *li-solid*, *li-regular*, and *li-brand* classes to use icons in your projects
  
```
  <!-- Filled with color icons -->
<i class="li-solid your-icon-class"></i>

<!-- Underlined icons -->
<i class="li-regular your-icon-class"></i>

Icons of companies and brands -->
<i class="li-brand your-icon-class"></i>
```
